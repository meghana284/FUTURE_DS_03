Customer Support Ticket Analysis & Resolution Insights
üåü Overview
This project dives deep into a real-world customer support ticket dataset to extract actionable insights. The goal is to understand customer pain points, evaluate support efficiency, and provide data-driven recommendations to enhance the overall customer service experience and reduce resolution times.

üéØ Project Objectives
Identify Common Issues: Determine the most frequent problems and requests raised by users.
Measure Resolution Efficiency: Analyze ticket resolution times across different priority levels.
Evaluate Customer Satisfaction: Track trends in customer satisfaction based on resolved tickets.
Provide Data-Driven Suggestions: Offer actionable insights for improving response times and overall support effectiveness.
üß† Skills Applied
Text Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling raw text data from ticket descriptions to derive meaningful keywords.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Uncovering patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the dataset.
Visualization and Insight Generation: Creating compelling visual representations to communicate complex data stories.
Resolution Time Analysis: Calculating and analyzing time-to-resolution metrics to identify bottlenecks.
Customer Satisfaction Insight Mapping: Connecting feedback to specific support interactions and channels.
üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
Google Colab: Cloud-based environment for notebook execution and collaboration.
Pandas: For robust data manipulation and analysis.
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
WordCloud: For generating visual representations of text data frequency.
CSV-based Dataset Analysis: Processing and deriving insights from structured CSV data.
üìä Key Visualizations & Insights
The dashboard focuses on the following key areas:

üßæ WordCloud of Frequent Issue Keywords: Visually highlights the most common themes and topics appearing in customer support tickets, providing a quick overview of prevalent issues.
üìå Top 10 Ticket Types: Identifies the primary categories of support requests, aiding in resource allocation and targeted training.
üü® Ticket Status Distribution by Type: Illustrates the lifecycle of tickets within different categories, revealing potential bottlenecks or efficient resolution paths.
‚è±Ô∏è Resolution Time Analysis by Ticket Priority: Compares the average resolution times across high, medium, and low priority tickets, indicating adherence to SLAs and areas for improvement.
‚≠ê Customer Satisfaction Rating by Support Channel: Maps customer feedback to the support channels used (e.g., chat, email, phone), pinpointing which channels are performing well and which may need refinement.
üìÅ Dataset
The analysis was performed on a simulated real-world customer support ticket dataset provided in CSV format. It includes essential attributes such as ticket ID, subject, status, priority, resolution time, customer rating, and support channel.
‚ú® Future Enhancements
Time-series Analysis: Analyze trends in ticket volume, resolution time, and satisfaction over specific periods.
Predictive Modeling: Explore building models to predict potential high-priority tickets or customer churn.
Interactive Dashboard: Integrate with tools like Plotly or Dash for a more interactive and dynamic web-based dashboard.
